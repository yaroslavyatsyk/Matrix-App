# MatrixCalculator

Welcome to the matrix calculator app. This app is assigned to help student—ñ to get more familiar with matrices and arithmetic operations on them.


For matrices, there are three basic arithmetic operations
* addition
* substraction
* multiplication

There are examples of each operation on two matrices.

1. Addition

In future, the app will be improved and expanded with more operations on matrices
